# Day 3: Treasure Island

This took a lot longer than it had any real right to...

I was kind of enjoying it a little too much. 

- I used modularity to make it a little easier to read through, it's text heavy so having it separated by functions helped me not get completely confused.

- Changed the start point just to give it a little more length.

- added in extra characters and interactions for a little variety and made sure there was at least two ways to get to the island and multiple ways for their to be a game over beyond traditional death.
